If you need to push a commit to a GitHub repo over HTTPS and you don't want to
provide a username &amp; password, a GitHub "fine-grained personal access token" is
the way to go[^fn:1]. The owner of the repo can create that token and configure
(1) to which repo(s) it provides access and (2) the kind of access it allows to
these repo(s), the _repository permissions_. The following screenshot shows some
of these permissions:

There are a lot of permissions you can configure, but to push commits to a repo,
you only need "**Read** access to metadata" and "**Read** and **Write** access to
code". The first one is mandatory and you need it to "search repositories, list
collaborators, and access repository metadata".

[^fn:1]: I prefer SSH to HTTPS, but I've worked with locked-down company laptops
    where SSH access was disabled.
