On Windows I use the SSH agent `pageant` to manage my keys for Git. This allows
me to use the same agent process from Windows and MSYS2 Zsh sessions. But after
I switched to `pageant` on a workstation that previously used the [Git Credential
Manager](https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager), Git commands that accessed a remote, failed:

```nil
C:\Users\Pieter\repos\my-repo> git pull
fatal: protocol error: bad line length character: logi
FATAL ERROR: Error reading from console: Error 109: The pipe has been ended.
```

The first hit by Google was this question on StackOverflow, [Git Remote: Error:
fatal: protocol error: bad line length character: Unab](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8170436/git-remote-error-fatal-protocol-error-bad-line-length-character-unab). Most answers pointed in
the direction of `pageant` and `plink`, where `plink` replaces the `ssh` command
as it can talk to `pageant`. Was `pageant` running? Were the keys loaded? Those
all checked out so I focussed on `plink`.

To determine if `plink` was able to connect to the repo server, I executed the
following command:

```nil
C:\Users\Pieter\repos\my-repo> plink -v -agent -P <port> <server>

Note the last line, which asks me for my username. It starts with the same
characters as the first line of the error message, `logi`. Another Google search
brought me to [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56803412) to the StackOverflow question mentioned before:

> TL;DR: Do not omit username@ in your remote URLs when on Windows.

By default SSH uses your current username, but `plink` doesn't do that. So when
Git calls `plink`, `plink` will ask as which user it should connect.

Indeed, the `.gitconfig` for that repo defined `origin` without the username:

```nil
[remote "origin"]
	url = ssh://<server>:<port>/<repo-path>
```

Once I added the username to the repo address,

```nil
[remote "origin"]
	url = ssh://<username>@<server>:<port>/<repo-path>
```

the Git commands worked.
