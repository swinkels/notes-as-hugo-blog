[Spacemacs](https://develop.spacemacs.org/) configures several key bindings to run Python unit tests, such as "run
test at point" and "run tests in current module". It lacks the functionality to
run doctests so I wrote a small Emacs package for that: [pydor](https://github.com/swinkels/pydor), the Python
doctest runner. The following animated GIF shows how it works in Spacemacs:

The Emacs package is implemented by an Emacs Lisp file to determine the location
of the docstring at point and a Python file to load and run the doctests in that
docstring.


## Finding the module to import {#finding-the-module-to-import}

The thing that took the most work was the Python code to import the module that
contains the docstring. I use Python module [doctest.DocTestFinder](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctestfinder-objects) to retrieve
the doctests and this function requires an imported module. This is really
straightforward if the module is a standalone module package. In that case you
just import it using its path. However, if the module is part of a package, you
have to import it via its full module name. Say you have a module `my_module.py`
in `mypackage/my_subpackage/my_module`, then you have to import the module as
`mypackage.my_subpackage.my_module`. The question then becomes what that full
module path is.

To find the full module path, I used the following heuristic:

1.  For each path `p` in `sys.path`.
2.  If `p` is not an ancestor of the module, go to 1.
3.  If each directory in the path from `p` to the module has a `__init__.py`,
    that path is the full module path. If not go to 1.

This works in a lot of cases, but it turns out the directories in "namespace
packages" do not have to have an `__init__.py`. It goes beyond the scope of this
note to explain what these packages are - the [Python Package User Guide](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/) contains
a good description [here](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/). For now it suffices that pydor doesn't support
namespace packages.


## Eask to replace Cask {#eask-to-replace-cask}

Another thing worthy of mention is my use of [Eask](https://emacs-eask.github.io/), a "CLI for building, running,
testing and managing your Emacs Lisp dependencies". Until now I used Cask for
this, but the documentation of Cask has become very wanting. For example, its
README contains the following question and answer:

> &gt; Why is everything you say inconsistent with cask.readthedocs.io?
>
> I would disregard nearly everything at cask.readthedocs.io [...]

I don't use Cask that much and each time I setup a new Emacs Lisp project, I
need to consult its documentation. If I then read a statement like that, it
doesn't inspire me with much confidence.

I went looking for an alternative and came across Eask, which labels itself the
"successor to Cask". Eask is well-documented and indeed, if you're familiar with
Cask, it's very easy to use productively. It _is_ written in JavaScript, but
that's not something you notice. It comes with pre-built binaries so you don't
have to dabble in node to install it.


## Future plans {#future-plans}

I use pydor in my work projects and there it works like a charm. It's a small
little project and I can imagine I use it as a test-bed to learn new things.
Especially two things come to mind:

-   publish pydor on MELPA
-   setup automatic builds on GitHub[^fn:1]

I've never done this for any of my hobby projects so it's a great way to get some
experience with this. Have a look at the [TODOs.org](https://github.com/swinkels/pydor/blob/main/TODOs.org) in the pydor repo. It lists
several other things I might work on.

[^fn:1]: I've done this for Azure DevOps and Atlassian Bamboo projects, just never
    for my personal projects on GitHub.
