In [my previous note]({{< relref "20231029" >}}) I created [an animated GIF](../10/pydor-runs-doctests.gif) of how I used Emacs package pydor
to run Python doctests, of course from Emacs. An animated GIF is a really good
way to show how a tool like that works. I wouldn't say that "an image says more
than a thousand words", but it does add a lot to a textual description.

The following two tools made it really easy to create the animated GIF:

-   [Peek](https://github.com/phw/peek) to record animated GIF images from my screen;
-   [Screenkey](https://www.thregr.org/wavexx/software/screenkey/) to show the keys being pressed.

Peek worked like a charm for my use case but unfortunately it is [no longer
maintained](https://github.com/phw/peek/issues/1191). According to the author, there are too many technical challenges
that need to be solved for Peek to have a future, such as a move to Wayland
and/or GTK3. As an alternative, he mentions [Kooha](https://github.com/SeaDve/Kooha) so that's a tool to keep in
mind.
