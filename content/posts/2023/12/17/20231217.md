In note [20230116]({{< relref "20230116" >}}) I talked about the offline API browser [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash), a MacOS
application that lets you download the HTML documentation for various software
packages and search it offline. Dash doesn't download the HTML documentation
from the original package location, but from its own sites. Other clients than
Dash can download these so-called docsets, but only Dash can download docsets
for older versions of a software package. Other clients can only access the most
recent build. This note describes how to build the docsets for older versions
yourself and install them side-by-side.

Directory <https://github.com/Kapeli/feeds> lists the XML files that each describe
where to download the documentation for one. Take for example [Python_3.xml](https://github.com/Kapeli/feeds/blob/master/Python_3.xml),
which starts as follows:

```xml
<entry>
    <version>.12.1</version>
    <ios_version>1</ios_version>
    <url>http://sanfrancisco.kapeli.com/feeds/Python_3.tgz</url>
    <url>http://london.kapeli.com/feeds/Python_3.tgz</url>
    <url>http://newyork.kapeli.com/feeds/Python_3.tgz</url>
    <url>http://tokyo.kapeli.com/feeds/Python_3.tgz</url>
    <url>http://frankfurt.kapeli.com/feeds/Python_3.tgz</url>
    <other-versions>
        <version><name>3.12.1</name></version>
        <version><name>3.12.0</name></version>
        <version><name>3.11.6</name></version>
        <version><name>3.11.5</name></version>
        <version><name>3.11.4</name></version>
```

The XML refers to other versions that are available/known. I googled for their
URL but didn't find much. The Google Group for Zeal, a Linux client for docsets,
has [this question](https://groups.google.com/g/zealdocs/c/GHWdXpr0uno) from August 2015 that asks where you can download older
versions. The thread doesn't give a definite answers, but it does mention Zeal
GitHub issue [#208](https://github.com/zealdocs/zeal/issues/208) (and to be complete, a broken link to an older ExtJS package).
About the issue, it's unresolved and ends with a question for pointers from
June 2023. So it seems that downloading the other, older docsets is not an
option for other clients.


## Creating and installing docsets for older packages {#creating-and-installing-docsets-for-older-packages}

Fortunately you can build the docsets yourself thanks to the excellent [doc2dash](https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash)
utility by Hynek Schlawack. For example, the following small script

-   downloads the offline documentation for Python 3.9.7 to `/tmp` and unzips it, and
-   calls doc2dash to create a docset named `Python-3.9.7`.

<!--listend-->

```sh
cd /tmp
wget https://docs.python.org/ftp/python/doc/3.9.7/python-3.9.7-docs-html.zip
unzip python-3.9.7-docs-html.zip
doc2dash --name Python-3.9.7 python-3.9.7-docs-html
```

When successful, these commands end with:

```text
Converting intersphinx docs from '/tmp/python-3.9.7-docs-html' to 'Python-3.9.docset'.
Parsing documentation...
Added 12,915 index entries.
Patching for TOCs... ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 100% 0:00:00
```

To install it, copy directory `/tmp/Python-3.9.docset` to `~/.docsets` and it
should be available to the Dash client of your choice. By the way, note that the
name of the docset is `Python-3.9.docset`, even though I specified the patch
version. I don't know what the rationale for that is - haven't looked into it
yet - but it's a nitpick.

One word of warning: do not call `doc2dash` for documentation in your current
directory. If you do something like `doc2dash --name Python-3.9.7 .`, `doc2dash`
will also pick up the new HTML files that it just generated, again and again and
again. This will result in really large directory trees...


## Enabling docsets in Emacs {#enabling-docsets-in-emacs}

In note [20230226]({{< relref "20230226" >}}) I describe how to configure a specific set of docsets for
Python mode in Spacemacs. That approach is still valid but it specifies the same
docsets for each Python project. This is not ideal when you use different Python
versions for different projects. Fortunately you can also configure
project-specific docsets.

[dash-docs](https://github.com/dash-docs-el/dash-docs) provides buffer-local variable `dash-docs-docsets` to list the docsets
that should be active for that buffer. If you set that variable as a
directory-local variable in a `.dir-locals.el`, you have your project-specific
docsets. For example, in one of my projects I use the following setup:

```emacs-lisp
;;; Directory Local Variables
;;; For more information see (info "(emacs) Directory Variables")

((python-mode . ((dash-docs-docsets . ("Python-3.9" "Pandas-1.3"))))
```

A more ad-hoc approach is via interactive function `helm-dash-activate-docset`.
Execute it, select the docset you also want to activate and you're off to go.
