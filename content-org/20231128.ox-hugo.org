In [[../10/20231029.org][my previous note]] I created [[../10/pydor-runs-doctests.gif][an animated GIF]] of how I used Emacs package pydor
to run Python doctests, of course from Emacs. An animated GIF is a really good
way to show how a tool like that works. I wouldn't say that "an image says more
than a thousand words", but it does add a lot to a textual description.

The following two tools made it really easy to create the animated GIF:

- [[https://github.com/phw/peek][Peek]] to record animated GIF images from my screen;
- [[https://www.thregr.org/wavexx/software/screenkey/][Screenkey]] to show the keys being pressed.

Peek worked like a charm for my use case but unfortunately it is [[https://github.com/phw/peek/issues/1191][no longer
maintained]]. According to the author, there are too many technical challenges
that need to be solved for Peek to have a future, such as a move to Wayland
and/or GTK3. As an alternative, he mentions [[https://github.com/SeaDve/Kooha][Kooha]] so that's a tool to keep in
mind.
