* Error dialog about pythoncom39.dll in conda virtualenv       :python:conda:

At a client I had to review the code of a new Python project. I cloned the repo,
used conda to create a virtualenv and finally let Poetry install all Python
dependencies. This went without a hitch but after the installation of the
dependencies, each subsequent Poetry command would show me an error dialog like
this:
#+begin_src
(my-venv) C:\Users\Pieter\repos\my-venv>poetry cache list --help
#+end_src

[[/20230105/poetry-error.png]]

So each Poetry command triggered a failing search for a specific procedure in a
DLL in my /base/ conda environment. Some googling (and trial & error) lead me to
[[https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32/blob/main/README.md#the-specified-procedure-could-not-be-found--entry-point-not-found-errors][this section]] of the README of the pywin32 package:
#+begin_quote
A very common report is that people install pywin32, but many imports fail with
errors similar to [The specified procedure could not be found / Entry-point not
found Errors?].

In almost all cases, this tends to mean there are other pywin32 DLLs installed
in your system, but in a different location than the new ones. This sometimes
happens in environments that come with pywin32 pre-shipped (eg, anaconda?).
#+end_quote
Indeed, this could describe the issue I encountered: pywin32 is one of the
dependencies installed, pythoncom39.dll is a pywin32 DLL and I'm working in a
conda virtualenv.

The README starts with telling you that pywin32 has a postinstall step, that you
have to execute manually. It doesn't tell you why that step is necessary but it
restates the advise after the quoted section. So here it goes:
#+begin_src
(my-venv) C:\Users\Pieter\repos\my-venv>cd C:\Users\Pieter\Miniconda3\envs\my-venv\Scripts
(my-venv) C:\Users\Pieter\Miniconda3\envs\my-venv\Scripts>python pywin32_postinstall.py -install
Parsed arguments are: Namespace(install=True, remove=False, wait=None, silent=False, quiet=False, destination='C:\\Users\\Pieter\\Miniconda3\\envs\\my-venv\\Lib\\site-packages')

#+end_src
So when you install pywin32, apparently the pywin32 DLLs aren't installed in a
location where Python, or a tool that relies on it such as Poetry, can find
them. The postinstall step copies them to a directory that does allow them to be
found. And indeed, after I executed this step, the Poetry commands didn't result
in the error dialog anymore.
